Python RAT
A simple Python Remote Administration Tool (RAT)!
You only need to install Pillow:

bash
Copy code
pip install pillow
Then, convert the file client.py and the .venv directory with py-auto-install!
Next, run the server!
Before that, you need to start server.py, and then client.py.
By default, they work with the local host, but you can change the server's IP address.
